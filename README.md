# 🚀 HVS Mass Unsub – Smart YouTube Subscription Manager

> A powerful Chrome Extension to efficiently manage and bulk unsubscribe YouTube channels with full user control.

---

## 📌 Overview

Over time, YouTube subscriptions can grow uncontrollably. Manually unsubscribing from hundreds of channels is slow and inefficient.

**HVS Mass Unsub** provides a clean, structured interface directly inside YouTube to:

- 📋 Detect all subscribed channels  
- ☑ Select specific channels  
- 🔄 Auto-load complete subscription list  
- 🚀 Bulk unsubscribe with live tracking  
- 🎯 Maintain full user control  

This extension runs entirely inside your browser session.

No data collection. No remote servers. No tracking.
